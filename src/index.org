I am Jin, a 5th year math PhD student at Stony Brook University,
advised by Alexander Kirillov. Here is my [[./doc/20211110-cv.pdf][CV]].

* Research

** Publications

+ [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05914][Categorical Center of Higher Genera and 4D Factorization
  Homology]], (preprint) arXiv:2107.05914

+ Explicit Factorization of a Categorical Center (joint with Ying
  Hong Tham), (preprint) to appear.

+ 4D Shadow State Sum Invariant, (preprint) to appear.

** Description

+ *Crane-Yetter theory in dimension two*

  Crane-Yetter theory (a state-sum model parallel to Walker-Wang
  model) is a fully extended TQFT. However, not until 2019 was
  its categorical aspect investigated. In my work, I proved the
  Crane-Yetter theory for all open surfaces are equivalent to a
  type of explicitly constructed category, namely the categorical
  centers of higher genera.

+ *$(q,t)$ -deformation of knot amplitudes*

  Quantum $6j$ -symbols are numerical presentations of the
  monoidal structures for $Rep(U_{q}\mathfrak{g})$. Their squares
  seem to admit $(q,t)$ -deformations by the numerical evidence
  discovered by Shamil Shakirov and Semeon Arthamonov. We aim to
  find a theoretic basis for such $(q,t)$ -deformation.

+ *Matrix-valued symmetric Macdonald polynomials*

  Alexander Kirillov and Pavel Etingof found a link between
  Macdonald symmetric polynomials and the generalized traces of
  (special) representations of quantum groups (type A) in the
  90s. It is natural to consider all representations instead, and
  ask for the properties of the corresponding matrix-valued
  symmetric polynomials.
