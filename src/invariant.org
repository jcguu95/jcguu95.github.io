* Invariant as presentation of data

- Redundant presentations

Mathematics is of the bottom-up nature. As a result, objects of
interest are often built up with primary concepts. This leads to
a trivial yet worth-noting phenomenon, that descriptions of an
object are often redundant. That is to say, one can often
describe a single objects in multiple different ways. While this
offers different perspectives, it could obscure the essence of an
object.

A recurring scheme in mathematics is to reduce such redundancy.
The simplest example, perhaps, is the equation, in which two
descriptions are available for the number $2$.

$$ 1 + 1 = 2. $$

Examples also arise in many problems in topology and geometry.
Knot theory, being the simplest yet nontrivial in particular, is
a rich source. Indeed, a knot, which is just a band in our space,
can be presented in various ways. Unlike the first example, it is
however an intellectually (very) expensive process to determine
which presentations describe the same object. For instance, it
isn't clear at all that all of the components in the figure
present the same knot.

It will be monumental to come up with a simpler distinguishing
method. Due to its simplicity and complexity, knot theory is an
interesting subject in modern mathematics. Elementary as it
seems, knot theory remains an active research area, and finds
important applications to modern quantum
physics [fn:1][fn:2][fn:3][fn:4], post quantum
cryptography [fn:5], chemistry and biology.

While some remains to find finer methods to reduce the complexity
of a given knot, some others take a different approach by
characterizing knots from another end. To understand this
approach, consider the simplest instance, that the one below is
clearly different from the knot above. A reason is that it has
two connected components instead of one.

Formally, this argument secretly uses a function
=number-of-component= on the space of knots to the space of
integers. The function tells us how many components the knot has,
and so while it evaluates to different integers on two
presentations, the two are known to be different. Similar
integer-valued functions are ubiquitous in math. For example, the
function =cardinality= distinguishes sets, and the function
=dimension= of all sorts distinguish spaces or other objects
(topological dimension of manifolds, cohomological dimension of
groups, combinatorial dimension of algebraic varieties.. etc.)

Two problems arise with this method. First of all, is this
function easier to compute? Could it be almost as hard to compute
as to determine the knot presentation? For instance, is it easy
to tell that first knot presented above has only one component?
Certainly, it is easier to know the number of components by
tracing the strand, but it is not so easy as the complexity goes
up. In such case, we say that our method is a (more) *efficient*
invariant.

The other problem: Does this function distinguishes different
knots completely? Could it be the case that two different knots
got evaluated to the same value? The answer is yes,
unfortunately. Shown below, same as the first knot above, a
trefoil knot has only one component. But they are different
knots. In this case, we say that our method is not a *complete*
invariant.

The goal is now clear. We aim to find knot invariants that are
both (more) efficient and (more) complete. A breakthrough was
made by Carl F. Gauss, who found his Gauss linking integral via
Gauss map around two centuries ago. Then knot theory hibernated
for another century, only to find its next breakthrough in the
end of the 19th century after the theory of fundamental groups
was born out of hands of Henri Poincar√©. There are a lot to be
said about the fundamental groups, but the most enlightening and
relevant part is that *it extended our notion of what an invariant
could be*.

Indeed, humans have used numbers as an, and perhaps the only,
abstract device to describe objects for a very long time. The
number of oranges in a bag, the size of a pita bread, the
amplitude of an angle, the interest rate of an investment, the
dimension of our space-time.. etc. However, the fundamental
group, being an invariant of spaces, uses algebraic objects as
abstract device. Such leap has led mathematicians to find finer
invariants in various disciplines. For example, algebraic
topologists refined their descriptions for spaces by using vector
spaces, rings, or even higher algebras [fn:6].

  _Theorem_ Finite type nilpotent spaces X and Y are weakly
  equivalent if and only if the E^{\infty}-algebras C^{\star}(X) and
  C^{\star}(Y) are quasi-isomorphic.

In the context of knot theory, such leap unexpectedly brought us
the quantum invariants of knots, first originated from Vaughan
Jones' work on subfactors in the 80s [fn:7]. Peculiarly, Jones
invariants take multivariate polynomials as values. Why such
invariants exist wasn't clear until the late 80s [fn:8]. A whole
quantum field theory about three-spaces is lurking behind the
existence of Jones invariant.

Quantum field theory follows the same line of thought in terms of
producing invariants. That is, instead of taking numbers, a
quantum field theory takes (higher) categories as
values [fn:9][fn:10], which are yet another kinds of algebraic
objects. The essential difference between higher categories and
groups is that the former is of higher-dimensional and therefore
has more space between its objects. This feature could allow us
to not only assign invariants to the whole object, but also
assign invariants to the inner structure of the objects. As a
result, the invariant is more flexible and powerful, in the sense
that it helps study objects alike to the original one as well.
