This is the new site I created using =org-mode= and =org-publish=.
Run the following elisp code, and run =M-x org-publish= in the
current file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-publish)
(setq org-publish-project-alist
      '(("org-notes"
         :base-directory "./src/"
         :base-extension "org"
         :publishing-directory "./"
         :recursive t
         :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
         :headline-levels 4
         :auto-preamble t
         :auto-sitemap t)
        ("org-static"
         :base-directory "./src/"
         :base-extension "css\\|js\\|png\\|jpg\\|gif\\|pdf\\|mp3\\|ogg\\|swf"
         :publishing-directory "./"
         :recursive t
         :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)
        ("org" :components ("org-notes" "org-static"))))
#+end_src
